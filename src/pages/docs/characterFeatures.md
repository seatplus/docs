Here a list of more features that are worth to be highlighted:

## Unknown Locations

There is a known limitation to ESI. One is not able to resolve
structures to which a character might not have access anymore.
Therefore, locations which are not resolvable can not be filtered by
region or system. Seatplus supports manual locations, which can be
accepted by a user with the necessairy permission:

{% figure src="/images/manual-location.png" alt="Manual Location view" /%}

{% figure src="/images/suggest-location.png" alt="Suggest Location modal" /%}

if to any point the location can resolved via esi, the manual location
will be removed.

## Asset Details

Ships, containers etc. can be reviewed with their slots
