This section explains how to configure seatplus. Whenever you do change
the `.env` File, you should run the following command to pickup changes
within the docker containers:

``` shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

## PUID & PGID
These values are of relative importance regarding the file permissions. You should not be in need to change them

## QUEUE_WORKERS
These can be increased and decreased as much as you need. Just make sure your server is able to provide enough
computational power. Sometimes less is more.

## PHP Settings
Sometimes you need to  increase the memory limit and max execution time for heavy queries. You may achieve this by
altering the following settings.
```dotenv
PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=256M
PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=99
```
