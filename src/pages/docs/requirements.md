title: Hard- & Software Requirements
description: 2 CPU, 2 GB RAM, 8-10 GB and docker-compose this what you need to start with seatplus.
---


As seatplus is a one-man project it will only be available as
docker-based installation. This ensures that users of seat-plus have the
same environment as the developers and allows for better support in any
case.

{% callout type="note" title="Traefik" %}
Seatplus ships with traefik as a reverse proxy server. If you wish to configure your own nginx or apache server you are
on yourself. If you have already traefik in use you may need to alter the external docker network inside the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Software Requirements

| Type           | Requirement   |
|:---------------|:--------------|
| Docker         | ^ 20.10       |

{% callout type="note" title="Docker compose version" %}
Docker Compose v2 brings Compose functionality into Docker itself. Youâ€™ll be able to use Compose wherever the latest Docker CLI is installed, no extra steps required. Underneath, Docker continues to use the features provided by the Compose project.

Existing docker-compose commands should map directly to their new docker compose counterparts. In most cases, you can drop the dash with no further changes required.

This documentation will use the old docker-compose commands. If you are using docker-compose v2 you may drop the dash.
