seatplus has and will be a hobby project of
[Herpaderp Aldent](https://evewho.com/character/95725047), thus help in
developing, testing, writing documentation etc is highly appreciated.

It would be helpful if you'd be interested in one the following:
- Vue.js
- Laravel (Vue - Inertia - Tailwind - Laravel Stack)
- Tailwind CSS

## Good Profiles:

1. You are know your way around php
2. You got no interest towards php, but you are keen towards vue.js
3. You are able to write JS-Tests (those are lacking atm)
4. You got no experience in neither php nor vue.js but are willing to
   learn
5. You got nothing of that sort, but you would like to submit
   feature-requests or bug-reports
